Details:

  **Introduced configuration checker API and depthcharge-audit-config**

  The depthcharge.checker API is designed to to facilitate configuration
  auditing, where the goal is to consistently and quickly identify common
  security pitfalls or known vulnerabilities, so time spent on security
  review efforts can be focused elsewhere (e.g., in newly developed code).
    
  The depthcharge.checker.ConfigChecker class defines the overarching
  framework and implements the common auditing and reporting functionality.
  The depthcharge.checker.UBootConfigChecker and .UBootHeaderChecker
  classes implement support for parsing .config and platform configuration
  header files, respectively.
    
  The audit() methods of these "checkers" produce depthcharge.checker.Report
  objects, which are sets of depthcharge.checker.SecurityRisk objects
  that describe the potential risks and provide a high-level, general
  recommendations. The Report class supports a few export formats, including
  html, csv, and Markdown.

  The depthcharge-audit-config script exposes this new API functionality
  via the command-line.

  **ARM is longer the default architecture, "Generic" is.**

  In the interest of being more user friendly, Depthcharge now defaults to an
  ARM-ish "Generic" architecture, which is still 32-bit and little endian. 

  By making no assumptions about registers and instruction set, we can exclude
  operations that would otherwise cause a target device to spin out of control.
  The goal here is try to balance provide some reasonable amount of
  functionality, while being resilient to platform-specific quirks that would
  otherwise cause grief fro a newcomer to Depthcharge.

  In order to use ARM-specific functionality, one must now do one of the
  following:

    * API: Create a Depthcharge context using `arch='arm'`
    * Scripts: pass an `--arch arm` argument

  See `arch/generic.py` for the other Generic architectures available.
  However, note that 64-bit and big-endian platforms have not yet undergone 
  testing.

  **Migration uboot.py submodule to a uboot subpackage**

  The migration of the uboot.py submodule to a uboot subpackage was
  performed in order to allow new additions to be introduced in a more
  organized manner. 

  The uboot.py submodule has been converted to a subpackage organized as
  follows:

     * depthcharge.uboot.board:      Platform and "board" configuration data
     * depthcharge.uboot.cmd_table:  Console command handler table inspection
     * depthcharge.uboot.env:        Environment (variable) functionality
     * depthcharge.uboot.jump_table: Exported jump table definitions

   This breaks the (unstable) v0.1.x API. Below is a summary of the v0.1.x
   items that have been removed, along with their corresponding replacements in
   the (also unstable) v0.2.x API.

   depthcharge.uboot.board:

   depthcharge.uboot.env:
    v0.1.x: depthcharge.uboot.raw_environment_regex()
            depthcharge.uboot.raw_env_var_regex()
            depthcharge.uboot.expand_environment()
            depthcharge.uboot.expand_variable()
            depthcharge.uboot.parse_raw_environment()

            depthcharge.uboot.save_raw_environment()
            depthcharge.uboot.create_raw_environment()
            depthcharge.uboot.parse_environment()
            depthcharge.uboot.load_environment()
            depthcharge.uboot.save_environment()

                        Replaced by:

    v0.2.x: depthcharge.uboot.env.raw_regex()
            depthcharge.uboot.env.raw_var_regex()
            depthcharge.uboot.env.expand()
            depthcharge.uboot.env.expand_variable()
            depthcharge.uboot.env.parse_raw()
            depthcharge.uboot.env.load_raw()
            depthcharge.uboot.env.save_raw()
            depthcharge.uboot.env.create_raw()
            depthcharge.uboot.env.load()
            depthcharge.uboot.env.save()


   depthcharge.uboot.jump_table:
    v0.1.x: depthcharge.uboot.jump_table_exports()  
            depthcharge.uboot.find_jump_table()

                        Replaced by:

    v0.2.x: depthcharge.uboot.jump_table.exports()
            depthcharge.uboot.jump_table.find()

  **Opt-in Operation Semantics**
  
  Previously, Depthcharge would attempt to automatically explore a device as much
  as possible when the depthcharge.Depthcharge context object is created (which
  is what is happening when the depthcharge-inspect is used).
  
  However, when beginning work on a bringing up MIPS support, it became clear
  that the (expected) failures resulting from previously untested U-Boot versions
  (including those heavily modified by a platform vendor) would be very unintuitive
  to new users of the Depthcharge toolkit.  In order to better to provide a better
  user experience (i.e. a less annoying and kludgy-feeling toolkit), as well as
  making adding new architecture support less of a hassle,  the platform inspection
  now behaves according to opt-in semantics, rather than opt-out semantics.
  
  In the depthcharge.Depthcharge constructor, there are now `allow_deploy`
  and `skip_deploy` options, whose semantics are detailed in the corresponding
  API documentation.  On the command-line, these ccorrespond to -A, --allow-deploy 
  and -S, --skip-deploy arguments.

  Similarly, the opt-out of operations requirinig a device crash or reboot reboot.
  The kwarg has always been `allow_reboot`, but the cmdline options has been 
  updated to match: -R, --allow-reboot

  **Payload base address and offset improvements**
  
  The code used to configure the address at which Depthcharge should 
  deploy payloads as been updated to address some deficiencies and 
  better match the promises made in the API docs.
  

2020-07-22: Depthcharge 0.1.1.post1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-release update to temporarily work around setup.py issue (#14)
affecting RTD builds until proper fix is merged in a later release.

Versions:

    Python module (`depthcharge`): 0.1.1.post1
    Companion Firmware: 0.1.0


2020-07-22: Depthcharge Release 0.1.1 ("Burn No Bridges")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Documentation and packaging fixes - no functional changes.

Versions:

    Python module (`depthcharge`): 0.1.1
    Companion Firmware: 0.1.0


2020-07-21: Depthcharge Release 0.1.0 ("Against the Grain")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial public release of Depthcharge.

Versions:

    Python module (`depthcharge`): 0.1.0
    Companion Firmware: 0.1.0

Current limitations:

    - Supports ARM (32-bit) only. Additional architecture support can be
        introduced via python/depthcharge/arch.py.

    - The Companion Firmware currently acts only as an I2C peripheral.
      This can certainly be expanded upon to also act as a SPI peripheral.

    - GoExecutor is the only Executor implementation. Boot commands could also
      be leveraged as such, provided that payloads are wrapped in appropriate
      image formats, preferably automatically by Depthcharge.
