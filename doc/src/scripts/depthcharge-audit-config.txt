Audit U-Boot configuration and report potential security risks.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V UBOOT_VERSION, --uboot-version UBOOT_VERSION
                        U-Boot version associated with configuration.
  -u <cfg>, --uboot-config <cfg>
                        U-Boot .config file to audit.
  -H <hdr>, --uboot-header <hdr>
                        U-Boot platform config header audit.
  -I <path>, --uboot-inc <path>
                        U-Boot include paths. Used only with -H/--uboot-
                        header. May be specified multiple times to add
                        multiple include paths.
  --cpp <cmd>           C preprocessor program to use when parsing headers.
                        Only used with -H/--uboot-header. Default is "cpp".
  --dummy-hdr <hdr>     Use an empty file for the specified header when
                        running the C Preprocessor. Used only with -H/--uboot-
                        header. May be specified multiple times to skip
                        irrelevant and problematic headers in include paths.
  -o <path>, --outfile <path>
                        Filename to write results to.
  --fmt <fmt>           Output format. If not specified, this will be selected
                        based extension.
  --cols <names>        Comma-separated list of columns to include in HTML or
                        CSV output.
  --impact-legend       Print a legend for impact abbreviations and exit.
  -N, --no-disclaimer   Supress disclaimer message.

 U-Boot .config and header files:

    More recent version of U-Boot leverage Kconfig functionality to configure
    builds, while older versions of U-Boot were largely configured via macro
    definitions in header files. There exists version which include a bit of
    both, as configuration items were transitioned. With regard to Depthcharge,
    auditing a .config file is generally simpler and more reliable.

    The decision of whether to use -u/--uboot-config, -H/--uboot-header, or
    both ultimately depends upon the version of the codebase you are reviewing.

    In general, Depthcharge's support for .config parsing is likely to yield
    better results more quickly, while parsing headers may require more effort
    in terms of locating relevant headers & include paths, as well as
    appeasing the C preprocessor.

    When working with headers, if an irrelevant #include directive or header
    file is proving problematic, note that you can direct Depthcharge to
    create dummy header files and place them at higher priority in the include
    search paths.

 Supported Output File Formats and Extensions:

    .csv        - CSV
    .html       - HTML
    .tab        - HTML, table only
    .md, .txt   - Markdown

 Columns:

    For column-based formats (csv, html) the inclusion and order of columns can
    be specified via a comma-separated list of column names passed to `--cols`.
    Below are the (case-insensitive) column names that may be used.

    * Identifier        Short name that uniquely identifies security risk
    * Summary           Brief summary of the security risk
    * Impact            Encoded string describing overall impact
                            See output of `--impact-legend` for a description
                            of each abbreviation.
    * Source:           Corresponding location within configuration file
    * Description       Detailed description of the security risk
    * Recommendation    High-level recommendation for eliminating or
                            mitigating the reported risk.

    When `--cols` is not specified, the following default is assumed.
    (The longer Description and Recommendation columns are omitted.)

        --cols Identifier,Impact,Summary,Source

 Markdown:

    When a Markdown file is produced, `--cols` is ignored. Each reported item
    will be in its own section, and all of the above fields will be included in
    the document, each in a subsections.

 Examples:

   Inspect a U-Boot .config file and save results to a Markdown file

    depthcharge-audit-config -V 2019.07 -u /path/to/uboot/.config -o report.md

   Inspect an i.MX53 evaluation kit's configuration header file, supplying a
   "dummy header" to satisfy an `#include <asm/arch/imx-regs.h>` directive
   that would otherwise require attempting a build or manually creating a
   symlink in the U-Boot source tree. Note that this command is run from the
   top-level of a U-Boot v2011.03 source tree.

    depthcharge-audit-config -V 2011.03 -H ./include/configs/mx53evk.h \
            -I ./include -I ./arch/arm/include \
            --dummy-hdr 'asm/arch/imx-regs.h' \
            -o ~/audit-summary.html
