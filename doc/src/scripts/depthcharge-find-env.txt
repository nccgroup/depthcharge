usage: depthcharge-find-env [options] -f <image file>

Search for U-Boot environment data (env_t structures) in a flash or memory dump

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f <path>, --file <path>
                        Binary image to search
  -a <value>, --address <value>
                        Base address of the flash or memory dump. Result are
                        shown with respect to this address. Use the default of
                        0 if interested in relative offsets.
  --arch <architecture>
                        CPU architecture.
  -o <path>, --outfile <path>
                        Filename prefix for output file(s). No files are
                        written if this is not provided. A .txt or .bin suffix
                        will be added to each file.
  -E, --expand          Expand environment variable definitions, such thatall
                        defined variable usages are resolved. Warningwill be
                        printed for any unresolved variables.
  -B, --binary          When saving an output file, write the binary
                        environment contents.This will include the env_t
                        metadata (CRC32 word, flags byte).
  -S, --summary         Only print the summary of located environment(s). Do
                        not print environment contents.

 examples:
    Print all environment instances found in mtdblock0.bin:

      depthcharge-find-env -f mtdblock0.bin

    Expand environment variables, and save the printed text to
    individual files named uboot_env_<address>_exp.txt.  The _exp
    portion is only added when -E, --expand is used.

      depthcharge-find-env -E -o uboot_env -f mtdblock0.bin

    Save the raw binary environment instances, including metadata,
    and print only a summary of the extracted items. Files will
    be saved to individual files named uboot_env_<address>.bin

      depthcharge-find-env -o uboot_env -S -B -f mtdblock0.bin
