usage: depthcharge-inspect [options] -c <device config>

Inspect a device's console environment and create a device configuration file.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c <cfg>, --config <cfg>
                        Device configuration file to load and update. It will
                        be created if it does not exist.
  -i <console dev>[:baudrate], --iface <console dev>[:baudrate]
                        Serial port interface connected to U-Boot console.
  -C <device>[:setting=value,...], --companion <device>[:setting=value,...]
                        Depthcharge companion device to use and its associated
                        settings. See the depthcharge.Companion documentation
                        for supported settings.
  -m <type>[:options,...], --monitor <type>[:options,...]
                        Attach a console monitor. Valid types: file, pipe,
                        colorpipe
  -X <key>[=<value>], --extra <key>[=<value>]
                        Specify extra operation-specific parameters as a key-
                        value pair. A value of True is implicit if a value is
                        not explicitly provided. Multiple instances of this
                        argument are permitted. See the documentation for
                        subclasses of depthcharge.Operation for supported
                        keyword arguments.
  -P <prompt str>, --prompt <prompt str>
                        Override expected U-Boot prompt string.
  -A, --allow-deploy    Allow payloads to be deployed and executed.
                        Functionality may be limited if this is not specified.
  -S, --skip-deploy     Skip payload deployment but allow execution; assume
                        payloads are already deployed and execute as-needed.
                        This has no effect when -A, --allow-deploy is used.
  -R, --allow-reboot    Allow operations that require crashing or rebooting
                        the target to be performed.

notes:
  This is generally the first Depthcharge script one will want to run when
  interacting with a new device.

  The resulting configuration file can passed to other Depthcharge scripts,
  alleviating the need to re-inspect the device each time a context object
  is created. (See depthcharge.Depthcharge.load() documentation.)

examples:
  Save results to a "dev.cfg" file and use the default serial interface
  settings (/dev/ttyUSB0 at 115200 baud).

    depthcharge-inspect -c dev.cfg

  Use the serial console located at /dev/ttyUSB2 at a speed of 19200 baud.

    depthcharge-inspect -i /dev/ttyUSB2:19200 -c dev.cfg

  Use a companion device attached to /dev/ttyACM1.  Configure the companion
  to operate on the target's I2C bus #2, for a speed of 250kHz. (Here, -i is
  omitted again to use the default settings.)

    depthcharge-inspect -C /dev/ttyACM1:i2c_bus=2,i2c_speed=250000 -c dev.cfg

  Supply a known prompt string to look for instead of having Depthcharge attempt
  to determine it:

    depthcharge-inspect --prompt "ACMEcorp >" -c my_config.cfg
