usage: depthcharge-mkenv [options] -f <infile> -o <outfile>

Make an environment that can be inserted into a target devices' NV storage

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f <path>, --file <path>
                        Input file containing environment in text form.
  -A <architecture>, --arch <architecture>
                        CPU architecture. Default: ARM
  -o <path>, --outfile <path>
                        Output file for binary environment.
  -S SIZE, --size SIZE  Environment size. Must match target's CONFIG_ENV_SIZE.
  -F FLAGS, --flags FLAGS
                        Set a value for the flags bytes. It is not included
                        otherwise.
  -H, --no-hdr          Do not include header metadata (CRC word, flag).

 examples:

    Create an environment for a target whose U-Boot image was not built with
    CONFIG_SYS_REDUNDAND_ENV, and CONFIG_ENV_SIZE=0x2000.

        depthcharge-mkenv -S 0x2000 -f env.txt -o env.bin

    Create an environment for use on a target device whose U-Boot image
    was built with CONFIG_SYS_REDUNDAND_ENV and CONFIG_ENV_SIZE=0x10000.
    Note that the flags value must be greater than or equal to that of the
    active environment that is being replaced.

        depthcharge-mkenv -S 0x10000 -F 0x5 -f env.txt -o env.bin

    Convert 2 KiB environment, but do not prepend a CRC32
    checksum (nor a flag word).

        depthcharge-mkenv -S 2K -H -f env.txt -o env.bin
