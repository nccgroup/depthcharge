    depthcharge-print -c dev.cfg -i all

  Print all commands supported by a device. Note that if you only
  want a summary of the commands, the detail help text can be omitted
  by not including '=details'

    depthcharge-print -c dev.cfg -i commands=details

  Print all environment variables, with all definitiions fully
  expanded. To view these as they are on the device, omit '=expand'.

  and expanded environment variables. Both usages are acceptable.
