usage: 
depthcharge-read-mem [options] -c <device config> -a <address> -l <length>
depthcharge-read-mem [options] -c <device config> -a <address> -l <length> -f <file>


Read memory contents to a file or display them in a hex dump.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c <cfg>, --config <cfg>
                        Device configuration file to load and update. It will
                        be created if it does not exist.
  -i <console dev>[:baudrate], --iface <console dev>[:baudrate]
                        Serial port interface connected to U-Boot console.
  -C <device>[:setting=value,...], --companion <device>[:setting=value,...]
                        Depthcharge companion device to use and its associated
                        settings. See the depthcharge.Companion documentation
                        for supported settings.
  -m <type>[:options,...], --monitor <type>[:options,...]
                        Attach a console monitor. Valid types: file, pipe,
                        colorpipe
  -X <key>[=<value>], --extra <key>[=<value>]
                        Specify extra operation-specific parameters as a key-
                        value pair. A value of True is implicit if a value is
                        not explicitly provided. Multiple instances of this
                        argument are permitted. See the documentation for
                        subclasses of depthcharge.Operation for supported
                        keyword arguments.
  -P <prompt str>, --prompt <prompt str>
                        Override expected U-Boot prompt string.
  -A, --allow-deploy    Allow payloads to be deployed and executed.
                        Functionality may be limited if this is not specified.
  -S, --skip-deploy     Skip payload deployment but allow execution; assume
                        payloads are already deployed and execute as-needed.
                        This has no effect when -A, --allow-deploy is used.
  -R, --allow-reboot    Allow operations that require crashing or rebooting
                        the target to be performed.
  -f <path>, --file <path>
                        Optional file to store data in.
  -a <value>, --address <value>
                        Target address to read from Default: 0x00000000
  -l <n>, --length <n>  Number of bytes to read
  --op <name>[,name,...]
                        Request that one of the specified
                        depthcharge.Operation implementations be used.
                        Depthcharge will attempt to choose the best available
                        option if this is not provided.

notes:
    If a filename is not provided, a textual hex dump will be printed.

    The following address and length suffixes are supported:

        * kB = 1000
        * K or kiB = 1024
        * MB = 1000 * 1000
        * M or MiB = 1024 * 1024
        * GB = 1000 * 1000 * 1000
        * G or GiB = 1024 * 1024 * 1024

    While optional, the use of the -c, --config option is STRONGLY ENCOURAGED.
    This will greatly speed up the execution time of this script, if it will
    be used multiple times for a given target. Similarly, once any payloads
    needed by a reader have been deployed to RAM, the -D, --skip-deploy
    option can be used to further speed up execution.

examples:
    Read 16384 bytes from 0x82000000 and display a hex dump:

      depthcharge-read-mem -c dev.cfg -a 0x82000000 -l 16384

    The following example is equivalent, but uses supported suffixes:

      depthcharge-read-mem -c dev.cfg -a 2080M  -l 16K

    This example instead reads data to a file. Note that Python's underscore
    syntax for readability is supported.

      depthcharge-read-mem -c dev.cfg -a 0x8200_0000 -l 16K -f data.bin

    Request Depthcharge to use the depthcharge.memory.SetexprMemoryReader class
    to read memory. Note that the `MemoryReader` suffix can be omitted, and
    that this argument is case-insensitve.

      depthcharge-read-mem -c dev.cfg -a 0x8200_0000 -l 1M -f data.bin --op setexpr
