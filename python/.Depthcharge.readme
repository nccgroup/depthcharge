## What is Depthcharge?

Depthcharge is a toolkit designed to support security research and
"jailbreaking" of embedded platforms using the [U-Boot] bootloader.
It consists of:

* An extensible Python 3 [depthcharge module]
* [Python scripts] built atop of the `depthcharge` module API
* [Depthcharge "Companion" firmware], which is used to perform attacks requiring a malicious peripheral device.
* Some example ["helper" payload binaries] and build scripts to get you started with U-Boot "standalone" program-esque payloads.

## Versioning

Depthcharge uses a [Semantic versioning] scheme for both the Python API and the Companion Firmware.
The version number for published releases will follow that of the Python API version.
The [CHANGELOG] shall document the current version state of both, along
with any compatibility information.

Currently, this project uses ["unstable"] version numbers; API-breaking changes
may occur within this minor version series, if deemed to be sufficiently
beneficial for the future of the project. Refer to the
CHANGELOG for guidance on handling any API changes.

Each published release will have a "codename". This serves no real purpose,
other than to amuse the author and add a little fun to preparing releases.
(Maybe they'll even be useful to remember!) The codenames are song titles from
punk bands, increasing alphabetically with each release.

[CHANGELOG]: https://github.com/nccgroup/depthcharge/blob/master/CHANGELOG
[Semantic versioning]: https://semver.org
["unstable"]: https://semver.org/#spec-item-4
