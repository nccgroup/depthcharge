            U-Boot's NetConsole functionality allows the interactive U-Boot command line to be
            presented via a network interface, rather than a serial port (i.e. UART) interface.
            This UDP-based functionality is designed to operate in conjunction with netcat
            on the corresponding host. The corresponding traffic is unauthenticated and plaintext.

            Thus, while a helpful development tools, this functionality does not appear to be
            designed nor intended for use a production settings. Doing so greatly exposes the attack
            surface of the relevant platform and could allow a network-resident attacker to execute
            console commands supported in the U-Boot environment.

            More information about NetConsole functionality can be found in the upstream documentation:

            attacker could allow the attacker to supply a maliciously crafted image that is large
            enough to overwrite memory containing the running (post-relocation) U-Boot executable.

            In this threat scenario, the concern is that the memory corruption would lead to
            malicious code execution. Given that TFTP is an unauthenticated file transfer
            mechanism that could otherwise be attacked, this vulnerability is envisioned to be
            abused in situations where U-Boot's Verified Boot functionality is in use.
